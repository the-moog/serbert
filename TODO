Things to do on SERBERT.

1) Split off serp/serp into separate library, for other projects.

2) Conditionally set DTR and RTS.

3) Options before port, as well as after.

5) Sort out i_get_lock_name() in seru.c. Environmental variable or default for
   lock path.

6) Add support for 3600 7200 14400 28800 baud these are supported by the pl2303
   usb to serial driver.

7) Suport for 1.5 stop bits.

8) Does low latency do anything?

9) Why does make distcheck finish badly with this:
./../../doc/serbert.texi:26: Argument of @parseargline has an extra }.

                                                 @null 
l.26 }
      
? 

serbert.info seems ok, though
